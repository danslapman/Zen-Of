# Zen-Of
My personal programming zen

- "Sparse" means wasting my time while reading
- Let explicit be explicit and implicit be implicit
- Expressiveness counts
- Purity beats complexity. All the times
- In the face of details avoid discarding them: they may be mission-critical
- Truly, if the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea
- If the implementation is not-so-easy to explain, then problem might be a bit more complex, than it looked in the beginning
- Or, it was kludged in the name of 'practicality'
- So, DIE FOR DRY
- I mean, one copy is TOO much
- Testability counts, also
